# BlackArch auto-update pipeline

`.github/workflows/auto-update.yml` + the scripts in this directory keep the
~4600 PKGBUILDs in `packages/` up to date with almost no human work:

```
detect (1 job, ~15 min)          build (N shards, ≤20 parallel)        publish (1 job)            report (1 job)
──────────────────────           ───────────────────────────           ──────────────             ─────────────
meta-all.sh   read+lint all  ──► build-shard.sh                   ──►  publish.sh            ──►  report.py
detect.py scan  nvchecker.toml     per package, fresh container:        commit PKGBUILDs            report.md/.json artifact
nvchecker     upstream versions      bump → updpkgsums / pkgver()       push to master              job summary
probe-sources (Sundays)              verifysource → makepkg -s          scripts/barelease           one tracking issue
detect.py plan  shards               pacman -U install test             (sign + repo-add + rsync)   seen-cache for next run
```

## What it does

* **Detection without committed state.** "Old" versions are read from the
  PKGBUILDs every run (no `oldver.json` to commit, nothing lost when a run
  fails). Release packages are compared with pacman's `vercmp` rules (ported
  to Python), so downgrades and odd tags are never applied. VCS packages
  (`pkgver()` + git source, ~1800) are checked with `git ls-remote` against the
  commit hash already in `pkgver` — no cloning unless something changed.
* **Supported upstreams** (generated automatically from the source URLs):
  GitHub tags, GitLab tags, PyPI, RubyGems, CPAN, SourceForge (RSS), git
  commits. On the current tree this tracks ~3150 of 4613 packages. Anything
  else can be added by hand in `nvchecker-overrides.toml`; the report lists
  the most common untracked hosts so you know where an override pays off.
* **Clean builds.** Every package builds in its own throw-away
  `blackarchlinux/blackarch:base-devel` container (same base as
  `travis/Dockerfile`), so missing `makedepends` are caught. The packages are
  then installed with `pacman -U` in a **second, fresh** container, which
  catches missing runtime depends (including ones only listed in
  makedepends) and file conflicts.
* **Build output is not trusted.** Upstream code runs in the build
  container, so the runner checks everything it returns before it can be
  published: the PKGBUILD may only differ in `pkgver`, `pkgrel` and (for
  release updates) the checksums; every package's `.PKGINFO` must name a
  package of *this* PKGBUILD with exactly the expected version and arch.
  Anything else is rejected as a build failure. The allowed lines are
  validated, not skipped: a `pkgver=` line must be exactly `pkgver=<version>`,
  checksum arrays may only hold quoted digests (with `SKIP` exactly where it
  was before). Symlinks, FIFOs and oversized files in the output are
  discarded, and the verified results are written to a directory the
  container never had access to. Build jobs hold no secrets.
* **Failures are not retried every day.** A package that failed for upstream
  version X is skipped (but still listed in the report as "previous run")
  until upstream moves past X, 7 days pass, or you run with `retry_failed`.
* **Publishing** reuses `scripts/barelease` unchanged (lock, repo-add, sign,
  rsync, banotify). Commits are `"<pkg>: auto-update to <ver>."` with
  `[skip ci]`. If the upload fails after the push, the packages are appended
  to `lists/to-release` so the normal release flow picks them up.

## Publish modes (`PUBLISH_MODE`)

| | `push` (default) | `pr` |
|---|---|---|
| Where commits go | straight to `master` | branch `auto-update/<date>-<run>`, **one PR per run** |
| When packages are uploaded | right after the push | when the PR is merged (`auto-update-release.yml`) |
| Rebuild on merge? | – | no: the packages built by the run are uploaded |
| Reviewer drops/edits a package | – | it is not uploaded; it goes to `lists/to-release` |
| Packages already in an open PR | – | skipped by later runs until the PR is merged/closed (if GitHub can't be asked, a publishing run stops instead of risking a duplicate PR) |

The release workflow uses `pull_request_target`: it runs from master's copy
of the workflow with ref `master`, so an environment restricted to master
works, and it only checks out master after the merge.

In `pr` mode build artifacts are kept 14 days; merge within that window or
the packages land in `lists/to-release` for a manual build. Squash, rebase
and merge commits all work (the release step compares file contents). Set the
mode with the repository variable `PUBLISH_MODE`, or per run with the
`publish_mode` input. If PRs are opened with the default token, enable
*Settings → Actions → Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull
requests*, or set `BA_BOT_TOKEN`.

## Builder image

The `image` job builds `.github/ci/Dockerfile` once per run and passes it to
the build shards as the `builder-image` artifact (kept for one day). This
avoids one Docker Hub pull per shard (anonymous pulls are rate-limited) and
gives every shard the same package versions. Nothing is stored under the
repository's Packages. If the artifact is missing, each shard builds the
image itself and the run continues with a warning.

## Relation to tests.yml

`tests.yml` (pkgcheck + Docker build of the PKGBUILDs changed in a PR) still
guards human PRs unchanged. For the bot:

* **push mode:** the bot's commits carry `[skip ci]`, so `tests.yml` doesn't run.
* **pr mode:** `pkgcheck` runs on the bot's PR as on any other, so reviewers see
  style problems in the PKGBUILDs it touches and can fix them in the PR (a
  package edited in the PR is not uploaded on merge but added to
  `lists/to-release`). The PR goes red if any of its PKGBUILDs already had a
  pkgcheck error. `build` is skipped for `auto-update/*` branches: those packages were already built and
  install-tested, and building a large batch one after another would exceed
  the 6-hour job limit.
* In both `tests.yml` jobs every changed PKGBUILD is checked or built, even
  after one fails; the job fails at the end and lists all failing packages
  (`pkgcheck` runs 4 files at a time; builds stay one after another).

This pipeline also runs the same checks itself, for the whole tree:

* `pkgcheck-all.sh` runs the same `pkgcheck` (pkgcheck-arch) on **every**
  PKGBUILD each day (results under "invalid PKGBUILD structure").
* every update is built in a fresh container like `travis/Dockerfile`
  does, **plus** an install test with `pacman -U` on a second fresh system.

## Whole-repo build status (rolling audit)

Besides updated packages, each run builds `audit` (default 300, variable
`AUDIT_PER_RUN`) other packages exactly as they are on master: never-tested
packages first, then PKGBUILDs changed since their last test, then the
oldest results. That is a full pass over all ~4600 packages roughly every two
weeks. Audit builds are never published.

The last result for every package is kept in a status database (Actions
cache, also copied into each report as `status-db.json`) together with a
fingerprint of the PKGBUILD it was built from. So the report lists **all**
currently failing packages, not just the ones touched today; a failure
disappears as soon as the package builds again, and a package whose
PKGBUILD was changed by a human is re-tested first. The summary shows for
how many packages the status is known (it starts at 0 and fills up during
the first cycle).

## Reverse dependencies and removal help

`detect.py` builds a dependency graph of the tree (`depgraph.json` in the
report artifact) from `depends`, `makedepends`, `checkdepends` and
`optdepends` (including `*_x86_64` arrays and `provides`). Split packages
are resolved per output: `depends=()` inside `package_python2-foo()`
replaces the top-level one, like makepkg does. For every package that fails
to build or has broken sources the report shows who needs which output and
a verdict:

* ✅ nothing in BlackArch needs it / only optional (optdepends)
* ⚠️ only needed by other failing packages (remove them together)
* ❌ needed by N working packages

Two extra sections use the same graph: **Removal candidates** (failing and
not needed by any working package) and **Python 2 packages that nothing
hard-depends on**, which lists every `python2-*` output, including the
`python2-` half of a `python-`/`python2-` pkgbase, with the suggested action
("drop `package_python2-foo()` from `python-foo`" or "remove package").
Only the BlackArch tree is considered; something an end user installs
directly, or an AUR package that depends on it, is invisible here.

## Duplicates of Arch Linux packages

Each run lists Arch's official `core`, `extra` and `multilib` packages (not
the AUR) and the report's **Also in Arch official repositories** section shows:

* packages built in `packages/` that Arch also ships, with both versions, how
  many BlackArch packages depend on them, and a ready-to-paste suggestion
  (remove `packages/<name>`, add `<name> <groups>` to `lists/official`). For
  split PKGBUILDs each output is checked separately;
* packages that are both built in `packages/` and listed in `lists/official`.

Nothing is removed automatically: a copy may be kept on purpose (newer,
patched, or an unrelated program with the same name).

## Report

Artifact `auto-update-report` (and the issue labelled `auto-update-report`):

| Section | Sources |
|---|---|
| ❌ fail to build | makepkg errors, dependency install failures, install test, timeouts |
| 🔗 invalid / broken sources | `updpkgsums`/`--verifysource` failures, dead git repos (ls-remote), weekly URL probe (404/410/DNS/refused/bad TLS) |
| 🧩 invalid / unexpected PKGBUILD | `pkgcheck` (as in tests.yml), `bash -n`, sourcing errors, `makepkg --printsrcinfo` lint, name ≠ dir, invalid pkgver/pkgrel, checksum count ≠ source count, missing `package()`, sources that don't use `$pkgver`, pkgver computed after the `pkgver=` line, upstream versions that aren't valid pkgvers |

Plus 🗑️ removal candidates and 🐍 unused Python 2 packages (see above).
`report.json` has the same data machine-readable, `depgraph.json` the full
reverse-dependency graph, `status-db.json` the last build result of every
package, and `logs/<pkg>/build.log` the (truncated) log of every build.

A dry run of the static checks on today's tree already finds real bugs, e.g.
`python-textract`, `python-pylzma`, `python-wayback` (syntax error in
`sha512sums`), `sploitego`, `vidalia` (2 checksums, 1 source),
`perl-crypt-curve25519` (pkgname is `perl-net-tftp`).

## Setup

1. Copy into the repo: `.github/ci/`, the three workflows in
   `.github/workflows/` (`auto-update.yml`, `auto-update-release.yml`, and the
   updated `tests.yml`) and `scripts/barelease` (it now only releases a repo
   lock it actually took).
2. **Signing key.** Create a dedicated signing key (e.g. "BlackArch CI"),
   sign it with the master key and **add it to `blackarch-keyring`** —
   otherwise users' pacman rejects every package it signs. Never put a
   developer's personal key into CI.
3. **Upload account.** A dedicated SSH user on blackarch.org that can only
   write the repo directory (and run what barelease/banotify run).
4. Create the environment **`blackarch-repo`** (Settings → Environments). Add
   required reviewers there if you want a human click before each upload.
   * secrets: `REPO_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` (armored), `REPO_GPG_PASSPHRASE`
     (optional), `REPO_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `BA_BOT_TOKEN` (optional: GitHub App
     / fine-grained token allowed to push to protected `master`)
   * variables: `REPO_GPG_KEY_ID` (use the full fingerprint),
     `REPO_SSH_USER`, `REPO_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` (output of
     `ssh-keyscan blackarch.org`), optional `REPO_SITEDIR` (barelease `-d`,
     default `/var/www/blackarch`). The host is always blackarch.org, because
     `scripts/balock` is hard-wired to it.
   * Before touching master, push mode checks that the key can sign and that
     SSH login works; if not, nothing is pushed and the report says why.
     After `barelease`, the repo database is downloaded again and its
     signature and new entries are verified.
   * If a run is cancelled while it holds the repo lock, release it with
     `scripts/balock -u`.
5. Repository variables: `AUTO_PUBLISH=true` turns publishing on for the
   daily run (default **off**: builds and reports only). `PUBLISH_MODE=pr`
   opens a PR instead of pushing (see above). `AUTO_RELEASE=false` commits
   PKGBUILDs but puts the packages in `lists/to-release` instead of
   uploading. `REPORT_ISSUE=false` disables the tracking issue.
   `PROBE_SOURCES=off|on|sundays` controls the source-URL probe of the daily run.

### Suggested rollout

1. Merge with `AUTO_PUBLISH` unset → a week of build-and-report only; fix or
   override what the report shows.
2. `AUTO_PUBLISH=true`, `PUBLISH_MODE=pr` → one PR a day; merging it releases.
3. `PUBLISH_MODE=push` → fully automatic.

Cancelling a run stops it: build shards that haven't started don't start,
and nothing is committed or released. The report still runs.

The first run will find many VCS packages behind; `max_updates` (default 250)
caps each run and the rest is picked up the following days.

## Manual runs (Actions → Auto-update packages → Run workflow)

The run summary opens with a **Run settings** table: what was
chosen for each input and the value actually used (after the repository
variables filled in `default`/`auto`).

* `packages: "foo bar"` — **added** to the normal run and built first:
  updated if upstream is newer, else rebuilt with `pkgrel+1` (handy after a
  library soname bump). Tick `only_these` to build **only** these packages
  (same as `max_updates: 0` + `audit: 0`).
* `publish: false` — test without touching master or the repo.
* `publish_mode: pr|push` — override `PUBLISH_MODE` for this run.
* `probe_sources: on|off|sundays` — run the URL probe now, skip it, or only
  on Sundays. `default` follows the `PROBE_SOURCES` variable (`sundays` if unset).
* `retry_failed: true` — ignore the failure cache.
* **Build test only** (no updates): `max_updates: 0`, `audit: 300` (or
  `4613` for the whole repo in one run: up to 200 shards, 20 at a time,
  roughly half a day), `publish: false`. Packages named in `packages` are
  always built, even with `max_updates: 0`.

## Tuning files

* `exclude.txt` — never auto-update (seeded from the EX list in
  `scripts/up-vcs-tools`); `lists/to-remove` is honoured too, and package
  names matching `^python2-|-py2$` are skipped (pinned legacy libraries;
  change with `--exclude-regex`).
* `nvchecker-overrides.toml` — hand-written nvchecker entries win over the
  generated ones.

## Limits / ideas for later

* Only x86_64 is built. `any` packages go to both arches through barelease
  as today; aarch64-specific builds could use `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runners
  with an arm builder image.
* Packages are built against the repo as it is; if a library and a tool that
  needs the new library update in the same run, the tool may fail once and
  succeed next run.
* Builds needing >14 GB disk or >60 min (`PER_PKG_TIMEOUT`) will be reported
  as failures; exclude them or give them a larger self-hosted runner.
